# InfoHunt

We aimed at creating an app which is integrating ChatGPT an open AI.

FRONTEND 
Stack used- REACT NATIVE EXPO 
Created a 3 screens.
1.for login page.
2.for signup page 
3.for query
We buy the credentials from the user through the sign up page and register him.
Then perform a login to redirect him in to a page where he can ask queries which will provide answer on the basis of data collected till the year 2021.

BACKEND 
Stack used -EXPRESS,NODE JS 
The query which has been collected from the query page in frontend will be given to backend for processing.This query is given to ChatGPT and the correaponding result will be showing in the query page.

We made use of "visual studio code" to type the program and pushed the same to a repository created in GitHub.
The repo has 2 branches, the backend files are in the "main" branch and the frontend in "master" branch
